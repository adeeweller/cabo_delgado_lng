# LNG Corporations and Democratic Accountability in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique


This file contains data and code for projects examining the effects of multinational liquified natural gas (LNG) corporations in Cabo Delgado, northern Mozambique.

Two folders are structured as follows:

Data:
  * Mozambique_R7.Data.English_7Feb19_release.w.local.info.sav
  * MOZ_r6.csv
  * MOZ_r5.csv
  * ACLED_Mozambique_Jan_2020_Oct_2024.csv

Code:
  * CD_survey.R
  * census_cleaning.R
  * Afrobarometer_cleaning.R
  * ACLED_cleaning.R


To run the code fully, users also need access to two proprietary files: census data and survey responses. For access to these files, please contact the lead project author (Adee Weller) at [adee.weller@emory.edu](adee.weller@emory.edu).
